# Configuration Files

## Introduction
Link Configuration files are in [JSON5 format](https://json5.org/), which is the same format as Dyalog APL configuration files. There is a user configuration file containing options that apply to all links, and directory configuraton files which apply to individual directories.

When performing an action that is related to a directory, Link will read both the user and directory configurations. If a setting is found in both places, the more specific directory setting will override the general user settting.

### User Configuration Files
You can have a user configuration file called `.linkconfig` , which records preferences that apply to all links, for example link creation options like -watch= or the `notify` setting. Under Microsoft Windows, this file is stored in the `Documents` folder, on other systems in the user's home directory.

A simple example of a user configuration file would be:

```
{
  LinkVersion: { ID: "4.0.11"},
  Debug: {
    notify: 1,
  },
  Settings: {
    watch: "ns",
  },
}
```
With the above user configuration file contents, Link will display notifications when processing changes to the source (notify:1), and default to only propagating changes from the namespace to source files (watch:ns). If a call to [Link.Create](../API/Link.Create.md) includes an explicit setting of the `watch` option, that will override the default.

Note that a configuration contains a `LinkVersion` section, which identifies the version of Link that wrote the file.

### Directory Configuration Files
Each linked directory may contain a `.linkconfig` file containing defaults that will apply when a link is created to that directory, or if the directory is imported. When [Link.Create](../API/Link.Create.md) or [Link.Export](../API/Link.Export.md) create a directory and create files in it, any non-default switch settings provided to tha API function will be recorded in a configuration file within the directory. This means that you no longer need to remember the options used to re-create the original link when continuing work, or importing the link into a runtime environment.

If you already have a Link folder which was created by an earlier version of Link, you can add a `.linkconfig` file using [Link.Configure](../API/Link.Configure.md). For example:

```
      ]Link.Create linkdemo /tmp/linkdemo
      ]Link.Configure linkdemo flatten:1
Was  flatten: 
```
The result documents that there was no previous setting for the option. A file called `/tmp/linkdemo/.linkconfig` is created, with the following contents:

```
{
  LinkVersion: { ID: "4.0.11"},
  Settings: {
    flatten: 1,
  },
}
```
### Stop and Trace flags

Directory configuration files also record stop and trace settings for functions and operators in the linked directory, which you can either manipulate in the editor, or using the API functions [Link.Stop](../API/Link.Stop.md) and [Link.Trace](../API/Link.Trace.md):

```
      ]link.stop linkdemo.stats.Mean 2
Was linkdemo.stats.Mean 1
```
These settings are recorded in a `SourceFlags` section of our configuration file, which now looks like this:

```
{
  LinkVersion: { ID: "4.0.11"},
  Settings: {
    flatten: 1,
  },
  SourceFlags: [
    {
      Name: "stats.Mean",
      Stop: [
        2,        
      ],
    },    
  ],
}
```

Note that there is no support for storing `⎕MONITOR` settings, as these are usually set under program control and used for reporting.

## Link.Configure
The [Link.Configure](../API/Link.Configure.md) API function and the corresponding user command, can be used to query and set the contents of both user and directory configuration files. For example, following on from the above example, we can query the current settings:

```
      ]link.configure linkdemo
Contents of "c:/tmp/linkdemo/.linkconfig":
   Settings  :  flatten:1 

      ]link.configure *
Contents of "C:\Users\mkrom\Documents\.linkconfig":
   Debug     :  notify:1 
   Settings  :  watch:ns 
```

You can change the settings by adding name:value pairs, and completely remove a setting by putting nothing after the colon:

```
      ]link.configure linkdemo flatten:0
Was  flatten:1 
      ]link.configure linkdemo
Contents of "c:/tmp/linkdemo/.linkconfig":
   Settings  :  flatten:0
      ]link.configure linkdemo flatten:
Was  flatten:1 
      ]link.configure linkdemo
No configuration options set in "c:/tmp/linkdemo/.linkconfig"
```


## The Configuration File Format
User and directory configuration files have the same format, with up to four top level names:

* **LinkVersion** identifies the version of Link that wrote the file.
* **Settings** This section can contain settings for most Link API function options. For a complete list, see the 
    documentation for [Link.Create](../API/Link.Create.md).
* **Debug** This section can contain two settings, debug and notify that assist with debugging Link, they are primarily aimed at Link Developers or expert APL users who believe Link might be misbehaving.
    - **debug:1** Disables error trapping within Link API functions
    - **debug:2** Stops at the beginning of each Link API call, to facilitate tracing
    - **notify:1** Causes Link to write confirmation to the APL session each time it defines a function
* **SourceFlags** Unlike Debug and Settings, SourceFlags is an array with one element per function or operator which has saved Stop and Trace settings. Each array element will contain a Name property, which is the name of the function or operator, and it may contain Stop and Trace, which are integer vectors containing line numbers.

An example of a configuration file with information in all sections is:

```
{
  LinkVersion: { ID: "4.0.11"},
  Debug: {
    notify:1,
  },
  Settings: {
    watch: "ns"1,
  },
  SourceFlags: [
    {
      Name: "stats.Mean",
      Stop: [
        2,        
      ],
    },    
  ],
}
```

### The `ignoreconfig` switch
If you manually edit a `.linkconfig` file and damage it so that it either becomes invalid JSON5 so that Link is unable to read it, or if Link is able to read it but complains that it has invalid contents, or if you simply want to ignore the configuration for other reasons, several API functions including Create, Import and Export have an `ignoreconfig` option:

```
      ]link.create linkdemo c:\tmp\linkdemo
Unknown Setting(s) in "c:\tmp\linkdemo/.linkconfig":  fasten 
      ]link.create linkdemo c:\tmp\linkdemo -ignoreconfig
Linked: #.linkdemo ←→ c:\tmp\linkdemo
```
