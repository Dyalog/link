 MODE←'MOCK'        ⍝ How to handle FSW events
 ⍝ ''                 Just make changes, hope that FSW will kick in while tests run
 ⍝                       Does not work at all.
 ⍝ 'ISOLATE'          Redirect changes to an isolate and use Breathe+delays in "assert" to wait for FSW events to catch up
 ⍝                       Works better, but is still subject to race conditions
 ⍝ 'MOCK'             Turn off FSW, make updates via functions defined by SetupSlave, which call Notify directly
 ⍝                       Seems to make
