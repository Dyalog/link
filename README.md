# Link
Link enables the use of text files as the primary storage mechanism for APL source code, and is expected to replace the use of traditional binary workspaces and component files for many new APL projects.

## Version 3.1
Version 3.1 was briefly used as a development branch in early 2023, before the decision was taken to make the next release 4.0.

It will eventually be deleted, and should not be used except by support personnel trying to re-create issues reported with early builds of Dyalog v19.0.
