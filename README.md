# Link
Link enables the use of text files as the primary storage mechanism for APL source code, and is expected to replace the use of traditional binary workspaces and component files for many new APL projects.

Note that two significantly different variants of Link are currently supported:

## Version 3.0
Version 3.0 was distributed with Dyalog version 18.2, and is also supported for use with version 18.0. It is recommended to anyone getting started with Link and Dyalog APL, until version 4.0 is released together with Dyalog version 19.0. Version 4.0 will be backwards compatible with 3.0.

The [online documentation](https://dyalog.github.io/link/) is maintained using markdown files which can be found in `docs` folder and deployed using `mkdocs` and `mike`, hosted with GitHub Pages.

This version is actively developed in the master branch of this repository and supported via GitHub issues and via normal Dyalog support channels. Some early versions of this code still identify themselves as version 2.1, but there have been so many behavioural changes that that version number has been changed to 3.0.

## Version 2.0
Version 2.0 is distributed with Dyalog APL versions 17.1 and 18.0. It is no longer being actively developed. Support (and fixes if necessary) are available to Dyalog customers via our normal support channels.

[Version 2.0 documentation](https://github.com/Dyalog/link/wiki) is hosted using the old GitHub wiki technology, and includes a [Version 2.0 API reference](https://github.com/Dyalog/link/wiki/API).
