# Link
Link enables the use of text files as the primary storage mechanism for APL source code, and is expected to replace the use of traditional binary workspaces and component files for many new APL projects. The current stable version is 4.0, which is distributed with version 19.0 and has [up-to-date user documentation](https://dyalog.github.io/link/).

# Link Versions
Although Link is developed as a GitHub project and it is possible to fork or clone it and configure Dyalog APL to use it in this fashion, most users of Link will be using a version which is delivered via the Dyalog installer and updated using the Dyalog patch mechanism. Currently supported versions are:

## Version 4.1 (Dyalog v20.0 - compatible with v19.0)
Version 4.1 will be shipped with Dyalog 20.0 and is being tested with Dyalog v19.0.

## Version 4.0 (Dyalog v19.0 - compatible with v18.2)
Version 4.0 was shipped with Dyalog 19.0 and works with version 18.2.  The [online documentation](https://dyalog.github.io/link/) is maintained using markdown files which can be found in `docs` folder and deployed using `mkdocs` and `mike`, hosted with GitHub Pages.

## Version 3.0 (Dyalog v18.2 - compatible with v18.0)
Version 3.0 is distributed with version 18.2 and works with version 18.0. 

## Version 2.0 (Dyalog v17.1 & 18.0)
Version 2.0 is distributed with Dyalog APL versions 17.1 and 18.0. It is no longer being actively developed. Support (and fixes if necessary) are available to Dyalog customers via our normal support channels.

[Version 2.0 documentation](https://github.com/Dyalog/link/wiki) is hosted using the old GitHub wiki technology, and includes a [Version 2.0 API reference](https://github.com/Dyalog/link/wiki/API).
